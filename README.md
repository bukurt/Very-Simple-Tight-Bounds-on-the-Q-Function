Abstract â€“ This paper presents realization of the paper [1] contains calculation of new lower and upper bounds on the Gaussian Q-function, which are in simple algebraic form that contain only two exponential terms. Lower and upper bounds are obtained from selected coefficients which are stated in the paper [1]. Moreover, this new lower and upper bounds allow Q-function to calculate simpler than numeric integration. In addition to realization of paper [1], combination of new Supertight bounds and its performance and accuracy are represent in this paper with comparing other methods such as numeric integration, Jensen-Cotes[2] methods and exponential representation [3].
